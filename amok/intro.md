_Amok_ is a documentation tool which produces beautiful documentation that is easy to maintain.

- Independent—docs evolve across multiple versions, independently from code
- Verified—code snippets are statically checked by a compiler
- Enriched—highlight, annotate, mark errors and even rewrite code after checking
- Adaptive—readers can import packages into scope to affect how names are displayed
- Accurate—docs are synched with code and re-checked whenever the code changes
- Elegant—docs are presented through a visually-pleasing user interface
