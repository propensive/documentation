# Advanced Type Mechanics

What is the difference between type parameters and type members, and when should we prefer one or the other?
How can we develop an intuition for contravariance, and when should we use it?
How can I logically understand how the compiler is typechecking?
Why will some given values be chosen instead of others?
What factors are relevant when the compiler is typechecking different pieces of code?

## Category Theory

Category theory provides a foundation for much of type theory, and an
understanding of category theory can make it easy to grasp many ideas in the
Scala type system. While that is out of scope for _Advanced Type Mechanics_, a
little category theory can go a long way in developing an intuition for how
types behave.

Many examples involving types are subtle
