## Windows Subsystem for Linux

Fury is best used on Windows with the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or WSL. As Fury is primarily a
command-line tool, it is not such an obvious fit for use on Windows, where interaction primarily takes place
through a graphical user interface.

While Windows has provided a terminal for running Batch programs, it has never offered such a rich shell
experience as Linux and Mac OS, which is preferred by most software developers. But several alternatives
exist:

- [Windows Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) offers a much more
  advanced shell experience
- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) provides an emulation layer providing a similar experience to Linux
- a virtual machine for running a contained installation of Linux, for example with
  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- WSL and WSL2
